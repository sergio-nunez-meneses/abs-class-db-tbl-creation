## abstract classes and database/table creation _on-the-fly_

Basic system built for understanding the concept of _class abstraction_, the creation of databases and tables _on-the-fly_, and for practicing _model-view-control_ (MVC) with template integration, and _object-oriented programming_ (OOP) in PHP.

Create the file **_sql.php_** inside the folder **_tools_**, fill it with the following code, and with your database and login information:

```php
<?php
define('DB_NAME', '');
define('DB_HOST', '');
define('DB_CHAR', '');
define('DB_USER', '');
define('DB_PASS', '');
define('PDO_OPTIONS', []);
```
